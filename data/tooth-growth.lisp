  "The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

Description
The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for
tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three
dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery
methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded
as VC).

Format
A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.
[,1] 	len 	numeric 	Tooth length
[,2] 	supp 	factor 	Supplement type (VC or OJ).
[,3] 	dose 	numeric 	Dose in milligrams/day
